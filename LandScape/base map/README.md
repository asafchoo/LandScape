# Base Map

Base Map is the second step in the workflow of LandScape. It doesn't have any parameters for now. 
So why do we need it? maybe in the future it will fuse with other steps of the workflow. But for now, it stands by itself. 
Basically what this step is doing is creating blank labeled layers that will be filled with your design details in the end. Also, it gets a map from an outsource service while the GPS location that you entered in Primary Data is in the center of the map, the cross between the diagonals of the square.
