Elevation use the location that was collected by primary data and with some parameters tweaking. 
* 'number of points' - number of samples points, rooted - the actual number points will be squered. if you enter 350, the actuall amount of points will be 122,500. as the number increase the resolution is increasing but it slows the system proportionaly. 
* 'contour line every... m' - option for filtering contour lines as needed, if it's "1" it will be contour lines of 1 meters, if it's 2 it will be 2 meters between contours. 
* 'threshold' - a parameter that effects (don't ask excatly how) the sensetivity of the function that tries to create the contours from the points. 
* 'distance between paths' - also, a parameter that effects the way it produces the contours. 

the last two need to be tweaked a little back and forth, so render the optimum result.
